Scene One (text):
	Intro:
		-Who are you
		-Who is the child
		-Who are the zombies
		-What happens if the zombies get the child
	Leader:
		-What is the park?
		-What are you doing in the park?

    It took the us 8 years to contain the boxes.  Most of us agreed to not put down boxes that we didn't have to - they all used to be spheres, didn't they?  Some people made death pacts with their loved ones, I did anyway.  Better to see someone dead than cubed.
    The cages where we keep the cubes scare me.  Officials say they are secure, but who knows?  It's good to be able and go visit, but I wish I felt less worried around them...

Scene Two (park):
	-Done lol (walk through the park with the kid, see the pen)
	-Timer on end

Scene Three (text):
	Follow up:
		-What was the pen?
	New circumstances:
		-Zombies escaped
		-Whats going on now
		-What happens if they get the kid
	Leader:
		-Where are you(house)
		-Whats happening (attack)
		-(how to move)
		-(how to shoot)

    I wasn't suprised when the boxes broke out of the cages.  I was suprised when it turned out that they can breed.  The government officials say to not panic, but its a little late for that.  It's every man for himself out here.  Keep your loved ones in sight and more importantly don't let those boxes get to them!
    Two shots should be enough to put down a box.  Move around by targeting and shooting the waypoint pillars.

Scene Four (outer house):
	TODO:
		-Same as house now, effectively
		-Waypoints only outside
		-Kid just paces

Scene Five (text):
	Followup:
		-You fought well
		-Enemies are coming faster
		-Kid is scared of what will happen
	Leader:
		-Kid makes a break for the house
		-Tells you promised to protect them
		-Enemies are coming thicker

    It turns out that these boxes don't just breed, they multiply!  Its dire out here, partner, and I don't have any good news for you.  I swore to my kids that I would put em down before letting the boxes swarm them, I know you did the same.  I hope you have the heart to do it.

Scene Six (inner house):
	NOTES:
		-If you shoot the kid, it dies
		-When the kid dies, the game ends
	Start:
		-Kid runs back into house
		-Running back and forth beween rooms
	Middle:
		-Enemies are coming in very fast
		-Confusion in house (can't keep track of kid)
	End:
		-Too many enemies
